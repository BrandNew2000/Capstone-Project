# EduSync-Using-C-Language

## Linux Parity

- Linux Compatibility has been added to the program. (In theory, MacOS compatibilty has also been added. However, it is untested.)
- Due to differences in design between the two OSs, the astrix (*) character is no longer printed when entering a password. However, it has been ensured that the entered password is not echoed to the terminal.
- Multiple declarations of 'file' had to be added to each function to ensure the proper execution of fclose().
- Many functions remain untested. Functionality is not guranteed.


## Introduction

- This project is a collaborative effort to create a student database management portal named "EduSync" using C language.
- It incorporates various features typically present in such systems, along with some innovative additions.
- The project runs solely on terminal as per the project requirements.

## Overview

The project demonstrates a database management system's core format with attempts to make real-life applications possible. Three tiers of login types are available: Admin, Faculty, and Student.
